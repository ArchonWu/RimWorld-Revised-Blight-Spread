# RimWorld Revised Blight Spread

**Description:**  
This mod improves the blight spreading behavior by preventing blight from crossing impassable objects such as walls and doors. With this change, blight can no longer spread through walls, effectively containing infestations within rooms.


# Requirements
- [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) (a popular patching library for RimWorld mods)


# Installation


## Compatibility
- Compatible with RimWorld version X.X (specify your target RimWorld version)
- Should work alongside most mods that do not alter blight spreading directly.
