# RimWorld Revised Blight Spread
This mod improves the blight spreading behavior by preventing blight from crossing impassable objects such as walls and doors, as long as the doors are closed. 
With this change, blight can no longer spread through walls, effectively containing infestations within rooms.

## Blight can spread through:
- Furniture (e.g. bed, table, etc.)
- Opened doors

## Blight does not spread through:
- Walls
- Closed doors

# Requirements
- [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) (a popular patching library for RimWorld mods)


# Installation
- Put the folder in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods

## Compatibility
- Compatible with RimWorld version 1.5
- Should work alongside most mods that do not alter blight spreading directly.
